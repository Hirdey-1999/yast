*YAST* is a TUI utility that will let you stream your favorite movies/tv-series in one command. This utility is built in Go using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for Seamless CLI experience, [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for beautiful TUI, [Go-Colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly) for Web-Scraping and [WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) API for Streaming. 

## ⚡️ Quick start

First, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Go**. Version `1.18` or higher is required.

## NOTE

Project still in development stage. Will be available to stream movies by end of August. In the meanwhile, you can look at these design docs on how we are planning to build this tool.
Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
